This program is allows you to have your physical Stream Deck and other control surfaces connected via USB to your local computer but act as if they are connected to the remote Companion server. The computers do not have to be on the same subnet/vlan, but should be reachable via a TCP connection, whether this is on the same LAN or via a VPN connection.
