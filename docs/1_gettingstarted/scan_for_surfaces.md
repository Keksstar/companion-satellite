If you disconnect, reconnect, or add new Satellite surfaces on the local machine, you will need to have the program perform a re-scan to detect those new devices.

You can do this in the Context menu by right-clicking on the Companion icon and choosing "Scan devices":
![Scan](images/scan.png?raw=true 'Scan')

You should then see the new devices connect to the Companion server, and they will show up in the web GUI of the Companion server as surfaces.
