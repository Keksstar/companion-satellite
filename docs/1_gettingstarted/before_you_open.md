This program is allows you to have your physical Stream Deck and other control surfaces connected via USB to your local computer but act as if they are connected to the remote Companion server. The computers do not have to be on the same subnet/vlan, but should be reachable via a TCP connection, whether this is on the same LAN or via a VPN connection.

- Connect the Stream Deck surfaces that you want to use.
- In the Elgato Stream Deck app, make sure to firmware upgrade the Stream Deck to the latest version available.
- Close the Elgato Stream Deck app. Companion Satellite will not detect your device if the Elgato Stream Deck app is open.
